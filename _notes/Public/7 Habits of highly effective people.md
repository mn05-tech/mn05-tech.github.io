- Treat your employees the way you want them to treat your customers
- You wouldn’t be rude to your customers, so why be rude to your employees who work for you and are loyal to you
- You pay your employees for their work. They volunteer their creativity by bringing in new ideas for work
- Excessive focus on P leads to loss of health, bank account loss and worn out machines
- Excessive focus on PC is similar to exercising  4 hrs a day to live longer but in the long run you spend more time exercising than ‘living’
- Growth should be evolutionary but the net effect is revolutionary #quote 
- How do you set KPIs for the P/PC philosophy?
